%\chapter{Implementation}
%In order to provide a proof of concept for the algorithms from chapter 3, this chapter contains details about
%a Java implementation of those algorithms. These algorithms got tested on plans that have been created by the
%PANDA planner from the institute of artificial intelligence at the university of Ulm. The plans are based on
%planning domains from the International Planning Competitions (IPC) that has been organized by the International
%Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS).
