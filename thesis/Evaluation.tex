\chapter{Evaluation Justification Algorithms}

The theoretical foundation for justification algorithms has already been established in \cite{Justification},
therefore the purpose of this work is to test the justification algorithms in order to provide a proof of concept. 
To achieve this an implementation for the algorithms that were discussed in Chapter 3 
has been tested with planning domains from the IPCs (International Planning Competitions). With the PANDA \cite{Panda} planning
system which has been developed by the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at Ulm University, solutions to 
these domains have been computed.
The computations of the justification algorithms took place on a Lenovo L480 Thinkpad with an Intel Core i5-8250U CPU at 1.6 GHz.
The solutions are given in the form of POCL plans which can be transformed to PO plans by simply removing the causal links.

Well and greedy justification have been tested with both POCL plans 
and PO plans. Therefore, every plan has been tested with 4 different 
justification algorithms. The tests on backward justification 
have been unsuccessful because the related algorithm
did not produce optimization on any of the tested plans,
which is caused by the fact that the test plans have been created by a
POCL planning system and are therefore backward justified by definition.  


To evaluate an optimization five different metrics have been used.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plan step-optimized plans: The amount of plans where plan steps were removed
    \item Makespan-optimized plans: The amount of plans with reduced makespan
    \item Optimized plan steps: The total amount of reduced plan steps
    \item Optimized makespan: The total amount of reduced makespan
    \item Optimization ratio: ($\frac{\vert \text{optimized plans} \vert}{\vert \text{Tested plans} \vert}$)
    \item Plan step ratio: ($\frac{\vert \text{output plan steps} \vert}{\vert \text{input plan steps} \vert}$)
    \item Average plan step optimization: ($\frac{\sum_{\Pi \in \text{plan step optimized plans}}\frac{\vert \text{output plan steps of } \Pi \vert} {\vert \text{input plan steps of } \Pi\vert}}{\vert \text{plan step optimized plans} \vert} $)
    \item Makespan ratio: ($\frac{\vert \text{output makepspan} \vert}{\vert \text{input makespan} \vert}$)
    \item Average makespan optimization: ($\frac{\sum_{\Pi \in  \text{makespan optimized plans}}\frac{\vert \text{output makespan of } \Pi \vert} {\vert \text{input makespan of } \Pi\vert}}{\vert \text{makespan optimized plans} \vert} $)
    \item Computation time: The time it took to compute the optimizations 
\end{itemize}

In the test set there are 461\,363 different plans that contain an overall amount of 8\,358\,208 plan steps.
The sum over the makespan of all plans is 6\,152\,343. 

As discussed in Chapter 3, all of the justification algorithms have a non-deterministic element.
The ordering in which the plan steps are being checked for their justification
is non-deterministic and can have an impact on the outcome of the optimization.
In order to take this problem into account, every algorithm will be executed with 10 different random seeds.
Additionally, the same test set will be provided with only one random seed therefore the non-deterministic impact can be evaluated.
For the tests with 10 random seeds 10 possibly different optimizations can arise.
The results in table 4.3 and 4.4 were computed by choosing one of the 10 optimizations with 
the highest amount of optimized plan steps.

\end{table}
Tables 4.1 and 4.2 show that the greedy justification algorithms generate a better overall optimization 
which is excepted since greedy justification is a stronger justification type. 
Both types of the greedy justification algorithms are optimizing over 10$\%$ more plan steps
than their well justification counterparts.
Even more significant is the differnce in the optimization ratio.
While the greedy justification algorithms find an optimization for almost every plan,
the well justification algorithms show much smaller optimization ratios with 
0.586 for PO plans and 0.219 for POCL plans. 
Also notable are the differences between the optimization of PO plans and POCL plans.
For well justification algorithms every optimization metric except the computation time is much better for PO plans.
Especially the amount of optimized plans and as a result of this also the optimization ratio.
For PO plans the amount of optimized plans are almost doubled in comparison those of the POCL plans.
The PO algorithm has a higher computation time since every removal of a plan step can cause the loop inside of the well justification algorithms to restart.
Therefore, a lower plan step ratio does result in a higher computation time.
For greedy justification the difference in optimization metrics for PO and POCL plans is much lower.
In fact on regarding table 4.2 greedy POCL algorithm preforms better at optimizing makespan than 
its PO counterpart. This effect is due to the random seed that has been used.
With another random seed the PO algorithm might preform better as can be seen in Table 4.4. 


In general better results for PO plans are excepted since 
the lack of causal links make PO plans easier modifiable and more optimizations are possible.
There are a lot of plans where an optimization can be done on the PO plan but not on the POCL plan.
But there are also some plans that result in a better optimization for POCL plans than for PO plans.
This can happen if there is a plan with multiple possible optimizations with some removing more
and some removing less plan steps. If the optimization that is removing less plan steps can not 
be chosen by the POCL algorithm, because of its added restrictions, the weaker optimization will only
be possible in the PO algorithm. Therefore, such plans work better with the POCL algorithm.

In the tested set of plans there are not many plans with different optimization options. Therefore, 
the non-deterministic element of the algorithms did not matter for most plans.
Nevertheless, slight improvements can be seen by comparing table 4.1 and 4.2 with table 4.3 and 4.4.
The only algorithm where the usage of multiple different seeds had no impact is the 
well justification algorithm on POCL plans.
The obvious downside of using 10 random seeds is the increase in computation time by an approximate factor of 10. 


In order to provide a perspective on the size of the plans (amount of plan steps),
the justification algorithms have been tested on a second set of plans.
The second set is designed to provide a greater diversity of plan sizes. 
On the first set most of the plans had an approximate amount of 20-30 plan steps.
In the second set the plans have a range of 5 to 70 plan steps.
The algorithms will use 1 random seed per plan. 
Table 4.5 to 4.8 display the test results for the second set while 
being sorted by length of the plans. 
To provide a more compact view the plans with similar plan length (e.g. size \textgreater{}10,size \textgreater{}20, size \textgreater{}30) have been 
put together.


In table 4.5 to 4.8 the biggest differences in optimization performances can be 
observed in the smaller plans (size 0 to 20).  
The greedy algorithms perform the best on smaller plans and get 
worse the bigger the plans become.
The plan and makespan ratios of well justification algorithms do not change a lot with the plan size.
Therefore, the bigger the plans the smaller the difference in optimization metrics between the algorithms.
Although, the lack of plans with a size $>$60 is causing some inconsistencies on the optimization ratios. 
The difference between the PO and POCL algorithms in the second test set is similar to those from the
first test. The PO algorithm perform, slightly better than its POCL counterpart and 
scale similarly with their Plan size.
